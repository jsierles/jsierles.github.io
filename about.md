I live in Sevilla, Spain, where I play flamenco guitar and eat lots of cured ham.

My wife, [Nict√©][nicte], is a talented flamenco dancer.

I work with Ruby, Rails, Chef and Docker at Rubytune.

Lately, I'm having fun learning mobile development with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native) and [Rubymotion](http:/rubymotion.com).
